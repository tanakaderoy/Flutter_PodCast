The Marvel Cinematic Universe\\'s new Spidey, Tom Holland, was Chris Hardwick\\'s guest on the latest installment of the Nerdist Podcast. And together, they\\'re spinning a web about Spider-Man: Homecoming. After sharing a funny story about the \\'70s Spider-Man TV series, Tom was quick to admit that most of his in-costume scenes were filmed in a motion capture studio. However, he stressed that it is almost always him in the costume. Tom also related the feeling of powerlessness he felt when his face was covered, before finding ways to convey his performance through the rest of his body. Chris and Tom also speak about the new tone used in Spider-Man: Homecoming, which plays a lot like a John Hughes movie. Although both Tom and Chris agreed that they would probably embrace a life of crime if they had superpowers. Tom went on to relate his Lip Sync Battle experience, and how he felt when he had to \"become\" Rihanna. Amazingly, Tom hasn\\'t had a chance to really process how much his life has changed since his first appearance as Spider-Man in Captain America: Civil War. He also pointed out that the final movie would work as a high school comedy even if all of the Spider-Man scenes were cut out of it. Additionally, Tom recalls the time that he forgot to use an American accent in one of the scenes from Homecoming. According to Tom, no one noticed it until he pointed it out. It\\'s a long chat between Tom and Chris, so sit back, and enjoy!  "}, "itunes$title": {"$t": "Tom Holland"}, "itunes$episodeType": {"$t": "full"}, "itunes$summary": {"$t": "Get ready for the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man!
